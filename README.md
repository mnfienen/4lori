# 4lori
hello world jupyter + mybinder

# Some notes

1.  to light up binder, copy your github repo name and paste it in the spot at mybinder.org/
2. you make a cool little button to launch from like this:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mnfienen/4lori/master)
3. This will, by default, open up a notebook environment
4. Note that it takes a minute or two to build the environment, but after an initial build is usually faster cached for the next peoples.
5. You can make it start in Jupyter Lab mode (rather then Jupyter notebook) to include some other stuffs like command line interface, etc.
